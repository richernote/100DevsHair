# 100Devs Salon Site

This is my take on the 100Devs salon site. 
My initial idea was to stage it as a site that provided products and services to balding men/those who have alopecia and those with beards.



### TODO
    - direct links in nav to positions on the page or made other pages for links;
    - refine discount bubble/ make it into a popup?
    - potentially add carosel to main section background image;
    - add heading to bottom lookbook section
    - adjust services section.
